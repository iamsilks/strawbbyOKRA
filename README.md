**strawbbyOKRA/strawbbyOKRA** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a horror videogame.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program on C# and how to use Unity3D
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing, but it could be useful if I could get some basic codes!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, just not math... Please.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: https://strawbbie.carrd.co
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am not actually a beginner in coding I just took a very long break and forgot about everything I knew LMAO
